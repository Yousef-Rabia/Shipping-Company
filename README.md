A project by Cairo engineering students for programming for first graders, which is a project we are going to build a simulator for Shipping Company .
# Project: Shipping-Company
## Course Name: Data Structures and Algorithms
## Course Code: CMP1040
<!--## Team Name: The ########-->

### This is an educational project for Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++ using Visual Studio IDE. It is a simulation of a space shipping company to deliver orders to users. So the company releases its trucks and assigns cargo to them every hour.

# Features
* There are 3 Modes:
    * Iteractive Mode: Writing the simulation's stages hour by hour on the console and create the output file at the end fo simulation.
    * Step By Step Mode: With every arbitary key press, the simulation move to the next stage (hour) and create the output file when the simulation's stages are finished.
    * Silent Mode: Create Output file of the simulation without showing the simulation stages on the console.
    
* There is an input and output files:
    * The simulator read all the information and proccess them as it needs to start simulation. [input.txt]
    * The output file contains the final statistics generated after the simulation. [output.txt]

* The simulation consists of:
    * Status of the shipping company at every hour.
    * Showing the numbers and IDs of the trucks in different states: (Moving, In Checkup, Avaliable) state
    * Showing the numbers of the cargos in different states: (Moving, Delivered, Waiting) state
