It is a simulation of a space shipping company to deliver orders to users. So the company releases its trucks and assigns cargo to them every hour.}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There are 3 Modes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Iteractive Mode\+: Writing the simulation\textquotesingle{}s stages hour by hour on the console and create the output file at the end fo simulation.
\item Step By Step Mode\+: With every arbitary key press, the simulation move to the next stage (hour) and create the output file when the simulation\textquotesingle{}s stages are finished.
\item Silent Mode\+: Create Output file of the simulation without showing the simulation stages on the console.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item There is an input and output files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The simulator read all the information and proccess them as it needs to start simulation. \mbox{[}input.\+txt\mbox{]}
\item The output file contains the final statistics generated after the simulation. \mbox{[}output.\+txt\mbox{]}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The simulation consists of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Status of the shipping company at every hour.
\item Showing the numbers and IDs of the trucks in different states\+: (In Execution, In Checkup, In Avaliable) state
\item Showing the numbers of the cargos in different states\+: (In Execution, In Completed, In Avaliable) state
